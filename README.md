# The Marketing Technologist
This repository contains the code for all my blogs on [The Marketing Technologist](http://themarketingtechnologist.co/). 
The Marketing Technologist is an initiative of the tech geeks at Greenhouse Group. We talk about analytics, code, data science and everything related to marketing technology. 
The articles I write for The Marketing Technologist reflect my findings and experiences on Data Science.
